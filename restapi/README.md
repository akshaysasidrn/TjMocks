# Mock REST API Server Documentation

## Overview

This Mock REST API Server is designed for testing and development purposes. It provides simulated endpoints for various HTTP methods and supports authentication methods like OAuth 2.0, Basic Authentication, and Bearer Token Authentication. The server can run on both HTTP and HTTPS protocols, and it includes request logging for debugging purposes.

## Usage

### Endpoints

#### GET Request

Send a GET request to `/api/get` to receive a mock response for a successful GET request.

**Response Body (200 OK)**:
```json
{
  "message": "GET request successful",
  "request": {
    "method": "GET",
    "url": "/api/get",
    "headers": { ...request headers... }
  }
}
```

#### POST Request

Send a POST request to `/api/post` with a JSON body to receive a mock response for a successful POST request.

**Response Body (200 OK)**:
```json
{
  "message": "POST request successful",
  "request": {
    "method": "POST",
    "url": "/api/post",
    "headers": { ...request headers... },
    "body": { ...request body... }
  }
}
```

#### PUT Request

Send a PUT request to `/api/put` with a JSON body to receive a mock response for a successful PUT request.

**Response Body (200 OK)**:
```json
{
  "message": "PUT request successful",
  "request": {
    "method": "PUT",
    "url": "/api/put",
    "headers": { ...request headers... },
    "body": { ...request body... }
  }
}
```

#### PATCH Request

Send a PATCH request to `/api/patch` with a JSON body to receive a mock response for a successful PATCH request.

**Response Body (200 OK)**:
```json
{
  "message": "PATCH request successful",
  "request": {
    "method": "PATCH",
    "url": "/api/patch",
    "headers": { ...request headers... },
    "body": { ...request body... }
  }
}
```

#### DELETE Request

Send a DELETE request to `/api/delete` to receive a mock response for a successful DELETE request.

**Response Body (200 OK)**:
```json
{
  "message": "DELETE request successful",
  "request": {
    "method": "DELETE",
    "url": "/api/delete",
    "headers": { ...request headers... }
  }
}
```

#### OAuth 2.0 Authorization

- **Authorization Endpoint**: `/oauth/authorize`
  - To obtain an authorization code, make a GET or POST request to this endpoint with appropriate client credentials.

**Response (302 Found)**:
- Redirects to the provided redirect_uri with an authorization code.
  
- **Token Endpoint**: `/oauth/token`
  - Exchange the authorization code for an access token by making a POST request to this endpoint with the code and client credentials.

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "code": "authorization_code",
  "client_id": "client_id",
  "client_secret": "client_secret",
  "grant_type": "authorization_code",
  "redirect_uri": "redirect_uri"
}
```

**Response (200 OK)**:
```json
{
  "access_token": "access_token",
  "refresh_token": "refresh_token"
}
```

#### Basic Authentication

Send a GET request to `/api/basic-auth` with HTTP Basic Authentication credentials to receive a mock response for a successful authentication.

**Response (200 OK)**:
- If Basic Authentication is successful.

**Response (401 Unauthorized)**:
- If Basic Authentication fails.

#### Bearer Token Authentication

Send a GET request to `/api/bearer-auth` with a bearer token in the Authorization header to receive a mock response for a successful authentication.

**Response (200 OK)**:
- If Bearer Token Authentication is successful.

**Response (401 Unauthorized)**:
- If Bearer Token Authentication fails.

### HTTPS Configuration

The server supports HTTPS for secure communications. It uses self-signed certificates for server and client verification.

- **Server SSL Certificate & Key**: Provided in the `sslFiles` directory.
- **Client Certificate Authority (CA)**: The client's certificate is used as the CA for client verification.

**Note**: Ensure to update the `server.crt` file with the appropriate CA information if using a custom CA for client verification.

## HTTPS Client Verification

A separate HTTPS server is set up for client verification. This server requires clients to provide a valid client certificate for authentication. If a client certificate is successfully verified, the connection is allowed, and requests are processed.

### Server Configuration

- **Server SSL Certificate & Key**: Provided in the `sslFiles` directory.
- **Client Certificate Authority (CA)**: The client's certificate is used as the CA for client verification.
- **Request Verification**: The server's configuration includes `requestCert: true`, ensuring that clients must provide a certificate for authentication.

## Environment Variables

- **HTTP_PORT**: Port number for HTTP requests. Default is `3001`.
- **HTTPS_PORT**: Port number for HTTPS requests. Default is `3443`.
- **CLIENT_VERIF_HTTPS_PORT**: Port number for HTTPS server with client verification. Default is `3444`.
- **REDIRECT_URI**: Redirect URI for OAuth 2.0 authorization. Default is `http://localhost:8082/oauth2/authorize`.
